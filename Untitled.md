Hi all. For those who read my stuff on the web: I'm moving my content from various blogs, pages and websites to a new, single website.

[https://fightingcomputers.nl](https://fightingcomputers.nl/ "https://fightingcomputers.nl/")

I hope to collect all my knowledge in a nice, digital garden for all to enjoy. I'm filling it as we speak. Let me know what you think about it, I'd appreciate that.

This site is built and deployed from an [#obsidian](https://oldbytes.space/tags/obsidian) vault on my PC with a single command, using [#quartz](https://oldbytes.space/tags/quartz). This enables me to deploy this anywhere I want, and keep control of all my written content, now and in the future.

The MEGA65 discovery blog will stay updated as I write more things about this lovely computer.
