Hi there! This website is a repository (or *digital garden*) of articles and guides about using 8-bit computers in the present age.

The title *"Fighting Computers"* comes from a quote I've read several years ago. The sub text was : computers were once invented to make life easier. Over the years, we've diverted from that path and made things more complicated, and what we once thought was beneficial turned out to be destructive and negative. This site is about going back to the computers of yesteryear to program them and use them just for the joy of simpler computing.

The main focus of this digital garden is the [Commodore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_International) line of products and the recently released [Mega65](https://mega65.org/) machine, which is a re-creation of the never released Commodore 65, with bugfixes and more advanced features.

*The MEGA 65*

Over the years I've posted about about 8-bit computers on my google Blogger website. That content will be moved to this site in the coming time.

Thank you for being here. You can check out the [[content/Readme|Readme]] page for more about me, and my projects. For questions or feedback, you can find me on [Mastodon](https://oldbytes.space/@wiebow) and on the MEGA65 [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5DNvESf).

This site is created using Quartz and my local Obsidian vault about retro computing. Quartz creates a static website from this vault, and in this way I am in total control over my content, and moving this site and all its content to another hosting service, if needed, should be trivial.
