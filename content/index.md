Hello there! This website is a repository (or *digital garden*) of articles, projects and guides about using 8-bit computers in the present age. I will also post about other things from my working life, but all content will be IT related and technical in nature.

You can check out the [Read Me](/Readme) page for more about me, and my other projects. For questions or feedback, you can find me on [Mastodon](https://oldbytes.space/@wiebow) and on the MEGA65 [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5DNvESf). Thank you for being here.

## Posts

In the navigation bar on the left, you can browse the *Projects* (series of articles about the same subject), *Shorts* (single articles) and *Guides* (how-to's about various subjects).  On the right you see the most recent posts.

>Bear with me as I am writing and moving content to this site. Over the years I've posted about 8-bit computers on my [Google Blogger](https://devdef.blogspot.com/) website. That content (and from other places) will be moved to this site, at a rate of *when-i-have-time-and-energy*. Also, other sites that carry my content will be moved here.

## Site Title

The title *"Fighting Computers"* comes from a quote I've read several years ago. The sub-text was : *computers were once invented to make life easier*. Yet, over the years, computers got more and more complicated, and what we once thought was beneficial turned out to be destructive and negative. This site is about going back to the computers of yesteryear to program them and use them just for the joy of simpler computing.

## Technical

This site is created using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and my local [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault about retro computing. Quartz creates a static website from this vault, and in this way I am in total control over my content, and moving this site and all its content to another hosting service, if needed, should be trivial.
