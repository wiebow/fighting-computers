Wiebo has been involved with microcomputers since the early 80’s explosion. Primarily a Commodore kid, he is still engaged with 8 bits at a time.

Apart from “working” with retrocomputers, he likes to program on PC as well, primarily in Godot Engine where he has made remakes of his old 8-bit favourite games, like Thrust, Choplifter and Scramble. These can be downloaded on [itch.io](https://wiebow.itch.io/).

His other claim to internet fame is being the creator of some of the most populair Quake 3 Arena (and Live) maps ever: [Overkill](https://www.lvlworld.com/review/id:80) and [No Class](https://www.lvlworld.com/review/id:495).

His other retro computer/programming and gaming blog can be found here: [https://devdef.blogspot.com/](https://devdef.blogspot.com/) while his github repos are here: [https://github.com/wiebow](https://github.com/wiebow)

He can be reached through comments on this blog, on the Mega65 discord server or on  [Mastodon](http://oldbytes.space/@wiebow).
